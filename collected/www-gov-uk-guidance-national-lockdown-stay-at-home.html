          If you need to travel:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           walk or cycle where possible
          </li>

           you must not share a car with anyone from outside your household or your support bubble, unless your journey is made for an exempt reason

          <li>

           wear a face covering on public transport, unless you’re exempt

           stay 2 metres apart from people you do not live with where possible, or 1 metre with extra precautions in place (such as wearing face coverings or increasing ventilation indoors)

          You must follow the social contact rules when travelling in private vehicles. This means you must not share enclosed private vehicles with anyone from outside your household or your support bubble, unless an exemption exists, such as you are sharing the vehicle with someone working (e.g. a taxi). Where a vehicle is open air, you must follow the outdoor gathering limits.
